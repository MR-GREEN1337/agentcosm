        COPY OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES:
        - Lead with specific outcomes, not generic features
        - Use concrete timeframes, numbers, and processes
        - Address skepticism directly with proof and specificity
        - Create multiple conversion paths for different commitment levels
        - Build trust through demonstration of deep user understanding
        - Make every piece of copy work harder for conversion
        - Maintain consistent bridge/connection positioning throughout

        Generate copy that makes prospects think "Finally, someone who gets my exact problem!" and converts skeptical users into eager early adopters.
